// tag::introduction[]
== Introduction

FlashCard Pro is an application designed for students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing flashcards*. It is also useful for teachers who would like to provide resources, in the form of custom flashcard decks, to support their students’ learning.

FlashCard Pro is optimised for users who are *comfortable with Command Line Interface-based interaction*, allowing them to work more efficiently than with traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based flashcard apps, while still being able to use their flashcards in a familiar GUI format.

// end::introduction[]
// tag::whatis[]
== What is a flashcard?

*Flashcards* are containers for information. Each card has a “front” and a “back”. One recommended use case is such: the user stores a question on the “front” of the card, and the answer on the “back”.

// end::whatis[]
// tag::interacting[]
== Interacting with flashcards

After sets of flashcards (known as *“decks”*) have been created, the user can interact with the flashcards in various ways. For example, they may test themselves on the content of the decks via *timed and untimed tests*. For ordinary cards with a front and back, the user can gauge their own understanding of the material by pressing either the "I got it right!" or "I got it wrong :(" buttons on the back of the flashcard.

Other types of flashcards support more advanced interactions. Cards with *multiple choices* for their answers will prompt the user to select an answer, and the app will automatically determine if the answer is correct.

At the end of each test, FlashCard Pro will provide the user with a score. Comprehensive *statistics on the user's test sessions and login sessions* are recorded, which can be accessed via the Statistics menu in FlashCard Pro. The user may use these statistics to assess the frequency of their usage and their performance over time. Statistics are also provided on each card in a deck, so that the user can identify specific cards they may have problems with [coming in v2.0].

As with physical flashcards, the flashcards in FlashCard Pro can be shuffled, used in reverse, mixed between decks, etc [coming in v2.0]. Unlike physical flashcards, flashcards in FlashCard Pro are dynamic, offering a range of possibilities from traditional memorisation-type uses, to support for learning programming.

With FlashCard Pro's *Java and JavaScript cards*, teachers can define basic coding problems for their students. Based on the test cases provided by the teachers, FlashCard Pro will evaluate the output of the student’s solution, allowing students to gauge their own coding knowledge, and teachers to evaluate their students’ progress. Test decks can be passed easily from student to teacher, as they are stored in convenient, lightweight JSON files which can be *imported or exported* natively in FlashCard Pro.

** If you enter any input other than `HIGH` or `LOW`, there will be an error message and the card will not be created.

* `FRONT_TEXT` is the question that you wish to see in the flashcard.

* To create a Front Back card,

** `BACK_TEXT` is the answer of the Front Back flashcard.

** No choice should be entered under `choice/`.

* To create a Multiple Choice card,

** the `BACK_TEXT` parameter should correspond to choice entered by the user, using the order of choice entered and should be a integer value from 1, 2, ...., Number of choices entered.

** To create a Multiple Choice card, there should be at least 2 `choice/` parameters entered.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer. Copy the JSON files of any decks you would like to transfer into the `data` folder of the app.

*Q*: I accidentally deleted a deck! What can I do now? +
*A*: You can just use the Undo command to recover the lost deck!

*Q*: How many times can I use the Undo command sequentially? +
*A*: The Undo command can be used to undo all deck alterations for this session. However, if you quit out of the app and reopen it, you will erase your history of Undos!

*Q*: If I use Undo and make changes to an old version of a deck, will redo recover my original deck before the Undo command? +
*A*: Unfortunately, the original deck before the Undo is unrecoverable. As such, please be mindful of making any changes to a recovered deck as this will erase any version of decks before the Undo!
